## What I Have Learned
I have learned a lot about applying object-oriented programming into
the form of this project. Having each file derive from one another,
makes for cleaner and more efficient coding practices.
Utilizing classes and being able to extend the properties of one to
other classes, reduces the amount of code needed to operate.
