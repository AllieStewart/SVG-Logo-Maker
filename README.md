## Description
Challenge 10 coursework for UT bootcamp. Uses Node.js. </br>
This program is designed to create an SVG logo, based on user input. </br>
Shape, shape color, text, and text color, are all determined when
the user starts the program and gives their responses. </br>
Colors can be inputted either with a keyword (ex: blue) or a hexadecimal (ex: #FFFFFF). </br>

## What I Have Learned
I have learned a lot about applying object-oriented programming into
the form of this project. </br>
Having each file derive from one another,
makes for cleaner and more efficient coding practices. </br>
Utilizing classes and being able to extend the properties of one to
other classes, reduces the amount of code needed to operate.
